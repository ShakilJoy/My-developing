            <p>
                You might saw me jumping,climbing building, and stoping running trains. But nobody pays me a dime for that work. That's why I am learning web development. I will not stop untill I become the web developer. To be a web developer I will have to study minimum 6 to 8 hours per day that is really tough for me. And I'll do it. I sha Allah.
